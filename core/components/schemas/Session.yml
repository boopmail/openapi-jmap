title: Schema for a JMAP Session
type: object
additionalProperties: true
required:
  - capabilities
  - accounts
  - primaryAccounts
  - username
properties:
  capabilities:
    description: An object specifying the capabilities of this server. Each key is a URI for a capability supported by the server. The value for each of these keys is an object with further information about the server’s capabilities in relation to that capability.
    type: object
    properties:
      "urn:ietf:params:jmap:core":
        $ref: "CoreCapability.yml"
    required:
      - "urn:ietf:params:jmap:core"
    additionalProperties: true
  accounts:
    description: A map of an account id to an Account object for each account (see Section 1.6.2) the user has access to.
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      $ref: "Account.yml"
  primaryAccounts:
    description: A map of capability URIs (as found in accountCapabilities) to the account id that is considered to be the user’s main or default account for data pertaining to that capability. If no account being returned belongs to the user, or in any other way there is no appropriate way to determine a default account, there MAY be no entry for a particular URI, even though that capability is supported by the server (and in the capabilities object). `urn:ietf:params:jmap:core` SHOULD NOT be present.
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
  username:
    description: The username associated with the given credentials, or the empty string if none.
    type: string
    default: ''
  apiUrl:
    description: The URL to use for JMAP API requests.
    type: string
  downloadUrl:
    description: The URL endpoint to use when downloading files, in URI Template (level 1) format [@!RFC6570]. The URL MUST contain variables called `accountId`, `blobId`, `type`, and `name`. The use of these variables is described in Section 6.2. Due to potential encoding issues with slashes in content types, it is RECOMMENDED to put the `type` variable in the query section of the URL.
    type: string
  uploadUrl:
    description: The URL endpoint to use when uploading files, in URI Template (level 1) format [@!RFC6570]. The URL MUST contain a variable called `accountId`. The use of this variable is described in Section 6.1.
    type: string
  eventSourceUrl:
    description: The URL to connect to for push events, as described in Section 7.3, in URI Template (level 1) format [@!RFC6570]. The URL MUST contain variables called `types`, `closeafter`, and `ping`. The use of these variables is described in Section 7.3.
    type: string
  state:
    description: A (preferably short) string representing the state of this object on the server. If the value of any other property on the Session object changes, this string will change. The current value is also returned on the API Response object (see Section 3.4), allowing clients to quickly determine if the session information has changed (e.g., an account has been added or removed), so they need to refetch the object.
    type: string
