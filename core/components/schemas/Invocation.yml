title: Method Invocation
description: |
  Method calls and responses are represented by the Invocation data type. This is a tuple,
  represented as a JSON array containing three elements:
    * A String name of the method to call or of the response.
    * A String[*] object containing named arguments for that method or response.
    * A String method call id: an arbitrary string from the client to be echoed back with
      the responses emitted by that method call (a method may return 1 or more responses, as it
      may make implicit calls to other methods; all responses initiated by this method call get
      the same method call id in the response).
