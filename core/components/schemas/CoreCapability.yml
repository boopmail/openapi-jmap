  maxObjectsInSet:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    description: The maximum number of objects the client may send to create, update, or destroy in a single `/set` type method call. This is the combined total, e.g., if the maximum is 10, you could not create 7 objects and destroy 6, as this would be 13 actions, which exceeds the limit.
