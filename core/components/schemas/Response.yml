properties:
  methodResponses:
    type: array
    description: |
      An array of responses, in the same format as the methodCalls on the Request object. The output of the methods MUST be added to the methodResponses array in the same order that the methods are processed.
    items:
      anyOf: 
        - $ref: "Invocation.yml"
        - $ref: "MethodLevelError.yml"
  createdIds:
    type: object
    description: |
      (optional; only returned if given in the request) A map of a (client-specified) creation id to the id the server assigned when a record was successfully created. This MUST include all creation ids passed in the original createdIds parameter of the Request object, as well as any additional ones added for newly created records.
  state:
    description: A (preferably short) string representing the state of this object on the server. If the value of any other property on the Session object changes, this string will change. The current value is also returned on the API Response object (see Section 3.4), allowing clients to quickly determine if the session information has changed (e.g., an account has been added or removed), so they need to refetch the object.
